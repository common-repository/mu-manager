It lets you disable, enable, and delete mu-plugins as you do with the standard plugins.


== Description ==

With Mu Manager you can manage the mu-plugins like the standard plugins.
You can disable, enable, and delete mu-plugins as you do with normal plugins.

The mu-plugins are the plugins that load before any standard plugin. In a normal WordPress installation they are located in the folder wp-content/mu-plugins.

Usually, WordPress doesn't allow you to deactivate the mu-plugins. With Mu Manager you can enable, disable, and delete mu-plugins without the need for FTP.

It's useful if you need to temporarily deactivate a mu-plugin, or to get rid of some mu-plugins installed by some hosting providers that you don't need.
Some hosting providers, such as HostGator or Bluehost, might automatically install for instance a must-use plugin that enables the Endurance Page Cache, which you totally don't need if you use a caching plugin.
With Mu Plugin Manager you can easily get rid of Endurance Page Cache, or whatever mu-plugin that you don't need.
